## STEP 1: Getting the first block from the blockchain

What we need to do is go and retrieve the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain. Now in theory what we should do is download the entire blockchain by requesting it from some node, but in addition to being complicated for beginners and time-consuming, currently (June 2025) the Bitcoin blockchain takes up about 652GB of space, which... Well, not everyone has such a hard drive. For what we need to do, that is, take a look at the first block, it is sufficient to download just the "initial part" of the blockchain without everything else.
